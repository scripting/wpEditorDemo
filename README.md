# wpEditorDemo

Fully functional browser-based editor that plugs into WordPress via the wpIdentity API. 

### Goals

For developers

1. API does all the networking, you can focus on editing.

3. Interop is easy because all editors use Markdown.

2. Users control the storage, you don't have to be a reseller, stick to what you do best.

For writers

3. Use your favorite editor, change your mind, use both.

4. Your files are yours, they don't belong to a single app.
